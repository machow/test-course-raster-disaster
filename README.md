# Test course to diagnose a build error in `raster` exercises

The course [Spatial analysis in R with sf and raster](https://github.com//datacamp/courses-geographic-information-systems-in-r) has a build warning on a few exercises that are not reproducible locally, or in Teach preview. It reads

> test failed with backend-error: Error: Fail because of runtime error: Cannot create a RasterLayer object from this file.

This course attempts to provide a minimal reproducible example of the problem in order to diagnose the underlying issue.
